# Genetic Algorithm
 Java Program to experiment on genetic algorithms.
## Getting Started
you can use the program to simulate population evolutions to approach solution for second degree numeric equations.

in order to launch a simulation you need to follow the following syntax passed as arguments.

```java
<popSize> <mutationProbability> <convergenceMargin> <maxBound> <elitismCap> <mutationCap> <highMutationProbability>
```
